Your robot just came online, and its first job is simple: fetch the box waiting on the input conveyor and carry it to the loading dock. To pick up the box, stand on the <span class="ui-ref">green pickup zone</span>, face the conveyor belt, and use the <span class="ui-ref">Pick Up Object</span> block. To drop off the box, stand on the <span class="ui-ref">red dropoff zone</span>, face the output conveyor belt, and use the <span class="ui-ref">Drop Object</span> block. To program the robot, click the <span class="ui-ref">Actions</span> tab in the visual programming window and drag blocks onto the canvas. Connect them top to bottom starting from the <span class="ui-ref">When Program Starts</span> block in the order you want the commands to run, then press <span class="ui-ref">Run Code</span> to see your program execute.`,
